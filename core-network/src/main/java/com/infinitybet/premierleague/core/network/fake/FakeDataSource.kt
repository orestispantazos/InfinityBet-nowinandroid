Liverpool won the first final back in 1981 (1-0), before Real Madrid beat JÃ¼rgen Kloppâ€™s side 3-1 in 2018.\n\nLiverpool are looking to win the European Cup/UEFA Champions League for the seventh time in their history â€“ a victory in Paris would take them level with AC Milan (7), and leave them only behind opponents Real Madrid (13) for the most overall victories across the two competitions.\n\nReal Madrid are aiming to win the European Cup/UEFA Champions League for the 14th time, which would then be twice as many as any other team (7, AC Milan). Los Blancos have lifted the trophy on each of the last seven occasions when they have appeared in the final, with their last defeat in the showpiece coming against Liverpool back in 1981 â€“ a game that was also played in Paris thanks to an Alan Kennedy winner.\n\nLiverpool manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp has faced Real Madrid more times than any other opponent in the UEFA Champions League (9), winning just three of those matches (D2 L4). Among teams he has faced at least three times in the competition, against no other opponent does Klopp have a lower win percentage (33%).\n\nTip: 2.10 - Liverpool (1)",
